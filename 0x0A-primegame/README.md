# Prime Game

## Overview
This project involves solving a competitive game scenario where players strategically remove prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers. 

## Concepts Needed
- Prime Numbers
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Game Theory
- Dynamic Programming/Memoization
- Python Programming

## Project Details
- Start Date: Jul 1, 2024 5:00 AM
- End Date: Jul 5, 2024 5:00 AM
- Checker Release Date: Jul 2, 2024 5:00 AM
- Auto Review at Deadline
- Winner Determination: Prototype: `def isWinner(x, nums)` where x is the number of rounds and nums is an array of n
- Results: Return the name of the player that won the most rounds, or None if the winner cannot be determined
- Constraints: n and x will not be larger than 10000, no importing packages
- Example: See example provided in the project details

## Requirements
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Execution Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with python3 (version 3.4.3)
- File Endings: All files should end with a new line
- File Structure: README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Coding Style: Follow PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- File Execution: All files must be executable

## Tasks
- Implement the `isWinner` function as described in the prototype
- Solve the game scenarios based on the rules provided

## Additional Notes
By understanding the concepts and utilizing the recommended resources, you will be well-prepared to tackle the mathematical and programming challenges in this project. Success lies in applying efficient algorithms and optimal strategies to determine the game's outcome.
