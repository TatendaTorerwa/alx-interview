#0x05. N Queens


##Concept Behind N Queens Problem
The N Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem in which the goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. In chess, a queen can attack another queen if they are on the same row, column, or diagonal.

The challenge is to find all possible ways to arrange N queens on the board so that no two queens threaten each other. This can be solved using backtracking, a technique that involves placing a queen, checking for safety, and then recursively attempting to place the next queen. If placing the next queen leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks, removing the previously placed queen and trying a different position.


##Project Overview
The “0x05. N Queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.
